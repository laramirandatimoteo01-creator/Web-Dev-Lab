    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Blue Haven Café started with a dream — to create a cozy corner 
      where people could slow down, sip freshly brewed coffee, and share 
      warm conversations. Inspired by a love for coffee culture and 
      homemade treats, we opened this café with one mission: to make 
      everyone feel at home. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the aroma of roasted beans to the sweetness of our pastries, 
      every detail is crafted with love. Whether you’re here for your 
      morning espresso, a study session, or just to relax, you’ll always 
      find a little piece of comfort at Blue Haven Café. ☁️
