    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Blue Haven Café began as a vision — to design a peaceful hideaway 
      where people could pause, enjoy quality coffee, and share meaningful 
      moments. Inspired by a passion for café culture and homemade recipes, 
      our founders opened Blue Haven with the hope of offering comfort in 
      every cup. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the gentle aroma of freshly roasted beans to the sweetness of 
      our pastries, everything is made with care. Whether you’re stopping by 
      for your daily brew, studying with friends, or unwinding after a long 
      day, you’ll always find warmth and calm at Blue Haven Café. ☁️
